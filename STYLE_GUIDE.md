# Style Guide

## Guiding Principles
- Favor explicit and concise code paths; shorter code that repeats itself is acceptable.
- Do not chase DRY abstractionsâ€”duplicate logic when it keeps the code compact and clear.
- Keep functions small and purpose-built; break behavior into short functions rather than large general helpers.

## Documentation
- Document every public-facing function or method with a JSDoc block describing purpose, parameters, and return value.
- Avoid inline comments; rely on descriptive names and structure so the code remains self-documenting.
